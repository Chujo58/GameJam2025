split out the layers like you asked! 

proper layer order:
hat (barely moves lol)
swoosh
low/bottom claw
top claw
tail
body

i know you said you already had the melee animation but there was a tiny error i found in it
so that is fixed in this version
but also if you dont feel like changing it/it's complicated to change absolutely zero worries
barely noticable anyways
