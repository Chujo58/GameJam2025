# Notes for next release:
(2025-01-13)
## Missing assets:
- [ ] Idle & walking animation with two claws.
- [ ] Idle & walking animation for top claw only.
- [ ] Dash animation for the top claw only doesn't have the swoosh vfx?

> If there ever is time, maybe fix the animation to do something using a Composite Animation/Texture holder to avoid the large number of files.

Change of plans (2025-01-14): do the composite thing, basically make a general node and then stack animated sprite 2d objects.
